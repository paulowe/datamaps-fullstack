You will have a tight feedback loop with your project leads along with experienced members on your team to ensure your success and project’s success in-order to benefit the client your team is working with."

    question: "Why don't you accept more students?",

      <>
        We would love to accept all of our good candidates, but from our
        perspective, this is what we see. <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            {" "}
            We can’t work with all the clients in the world, because the quality
            of work and projects is just not scalable. We need to be incredibly
            selective with our leads because any risk of wasting an entire six
            months of time would ultimately be counterproductive for both our
            clients and students.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            We can’t have enormous teams because productivity inherently goes
            down, and work becomes less meaningful if anyone is tasked with
            completing a miniscule part of the project. On top of that, there
            are physical limits on the number of groups we can meet in person or
            through Zoom.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can only interview a fixed number of candidates, no matter how
            many good ones apply. We can only take as many candidates as our
            projects leads can support along with the scope of the projects
            itself. We want to take everyone who is qualified and we want to
            take on more projects, but for the reasons above, we just can’t.
          </li>
        </ul>
        That being said, we are looking into ways we can accommodate for members
        in the future such as holding more external events and tech talks,
        expanding our interview process to interview more candidates, and
        increasing our training program for more Product Managers/Technical
        Leads to take on more projects but maintain the high quality work we are
        know for.
